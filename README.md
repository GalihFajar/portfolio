# Portofolio

This project is my portofolio page that built using React-Typescript (Next JS) and Tailwind CSS to style it. The purpose if this project is to make a simple portofolio (for myself of course) that emphasize the core features of what a portofolio should be (but not to replace resume/CV) and can be recycled by anyone.

## Getting Started

After you've pulled this repo, the first things you want to add the modules:

```
npm install
# or
yarn add

```

To start the development server (and thus preview the current portofolio):

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open the http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Make It Your Own

If you want to stay with the current template, you can edit the components in `src/components`. The three components you may want to edit are `Card.tsx`, `ContactMe.tsx` and `Introduction.tsx`. If you are familiar with React, this should not be a problem to you, otherwise you can refer to React docs [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

Another thing to note is all the images that is defined here are static images (I did not include my images in this repo), which is according to Next.js docs should be put in `public` directory. Otherwise, you can host image anywhere (e.g. AWS, GCP, or any image hosting you prefer).
